**Introduction**

This research and analysis was performed in order to gain a better understanding of the ways in which turbidity is related to or affected by river discharge levels in the lower Columbia River between Washington and Oregon states. Turbidity is a measure of water clarity, used as a proxy to estimate the amount of sediment is suspended within the water, with high turbidity indicating lower clarity of water or higher amound of dissolved sediment and low turbidity indicating higher clarity of water or less dissolved sediment. River discharge describes the volume of water flowing through a given section of the river. Understanding the effects of river discharge on turbidity can help us better understand how storms may impact water quality, with the Columbia River serving as a source of drinking water for roughly 5 million people in Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Idaho.

**Hypothesis**

It is hypothesized that river discharge and turbidity will have a positive correlation, meaning that when river discharge increases so will turbidity. When river discharge increases, so does river velocity, meaning that water can more easily pick up and transport sediments on the bottom of the river. Additionally, increased river discharge means higher water level, allowing the river to pick up sediment higher up the river bank that is otherwise not affected by river flow. This stream bank erosion will increse turbidity in the river. This research aims to determine whether this correlation exists by performing statistical analysis between river discharge and turbidity levels at a USGS river measurement station in Vancouver, Washington in the years 2018, 2019, and parts of 2022 and 2023.

**Results**

Regression analysis between long term river discharge and turbidity data in the Columbia River in 2018, 2019, 2022, and 2023 showed that there is a strong positive quadratic correlation between discharge and turbidity with a relatively high degree of annual variation. Over three year-long sample periods, correlation values of 81%, 70%, and 93% (in 2018, 2019, and 2022-2023, respectively) were obtained. This means that to a high degree, river discharge is an influential factor in determining the turbidity level in the Columbia River. It is also significant that the correlation was quadratic instead of linear. This is likely due to the range of normal discharge level compared to flood stage discharge. When the river is within a normal range, there will not be a significant change to turbidity. However when the river advances to flood stage, there will be an exponential increase in turbidity due to the fact that the river level is advancing higher up and collecting more material. There were several outliers in each data set, suggesting that other factors (rainfall versus snowmelt as a water source, upstream conditions including weather, construction, geographic conditions, and more) are also having significant impacts on turbidity levels.

**Limitations and Future Work**

Because of the nature of data collection at this station (bank surface mounted flow meter and nephelometer), data may not be at all times perfectly representative of conditions throughout the rest of the river. Additionally, this research only includes analysis of data from one geographic location, not considering whether this pattern is reflected in other rivers. Additionally, several small gaps existed in raw data that had to be interpolated over, introducing potential inaccuracy in data points used for regression analysis. In future research it would be helpful to have more reliable data collection with fewer gaps, and to have more widespread data collection in other rivers as to see if this pattern exists in other geographic locations.
